# Python-Basics

This repository documents my journey of rebuilding **Python fundamentals from scratch** with a strong focus on
understanding, documentation, and clean implementation.

The goal is not to rush into projects or advanced topics, but to build a **solid foundation** that can later support
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and real-world software development.
