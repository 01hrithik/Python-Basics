# when u want to merge something we used addition
# example : u want two ice-cream cones 
# each cone price is 40
# now u asked to ur mom to give u money for two cones
# so she will give u 40  + 40 = 80
# you go to ice-cream shop and give 80 to shopkeeper
# shopkeeper will give u two ice-cream cones        
# and you enjoy your ice-cream

# code representation of above example
ice_cream_cone_price = 40
total_cone_price = ice_cream_cone_price + ice_cream_cone_price
print("invoice for two ice-cream cones is :", total_cone_price)
